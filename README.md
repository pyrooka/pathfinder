# Pathfinder QGIS plugin
QGIS plugin for find the best path between two points in a raster layer.

## Notes
- only tested under Linux.
- now the algorithm is in python.
## Install
- download the repo
- copy the directory (or create a symlink) to the QGIS plugin dir (in linux it's ~/.qgis2/python/plugins)

## Sample video
Note: because of the whole algorithm is in python now may it's slower than in the video.
