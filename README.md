# Pathfinder QGIS plugin
QGIS plugin for find the best path between two points in a raster layer.

## Notes
- Still under development!! You can expect some glitch and bug.
- Only tested under Linux And Windows with QGIS 2.18.14.
- Now the algorithm is in Python.
## Install
- Download the repo.
- Copy the directory (or create a symlink) to the QGIS plugin dir (in linux it's ~/.qgis2/python/plugins).
- Start QGIS. In the plugins window enable the "Path finder" under the installed plugins. You may have to enable experimental plugins too.

## Sample video
Note: because of the whole algorithm is in python now may it's slower than in the video.
